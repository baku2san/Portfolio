# Copilot Instructions for Portfolio Project

This is a Blazor WebAssembly portfolio website project. When helping with code generation or suggestions, please follow these guidelines:

## Project Context

- Framework: Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 8.0)
- UI Framework: Bootstrap (with custom CSS)
- Language: C# with Razor components
- Purpose: Personal portfolio website

## Coding Conventions

- Use C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private fields)
- Follow .NET coding standards
- Use nullable reference types (enabled in project)
- Prefer explicit types over var when type is not obvious
- Use expression-bodied members for simple properties and methods

## Component Structure

- Keep components in the Pages/ folder for routable pages
- Use the Layout/ folder for layout components
- Place shared components in appropriate subfolders
- Use @page directive for routable components
- Use @inject for dependency injection

## Styling Guidelines

- Use Bootstrap classes for responsive design
- Custom CSS should be placed in component-specific .razor.css files
- Global styles go in wwwroot/css/app.css
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles

## Best Practices

- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Use StateHasChanged() when manually updating UI
- Dispose of resources properly in components
- Use @key directive for dynamic lists

## File Naming

- Razor components: PascalCase.razor
- CSS files: ComponentName.razor.css
- C# classes: PascalCase.cs

## Common Patterns

- Use @code blocks for component logic
- Implement IDisposable for cleanup when needed
- Use [Parameter] for component parameters
- Use EventCallback for component events

When generating code, please ensure it follows these patterns and integrates well with the existing project structure.
